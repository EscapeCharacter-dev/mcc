# Magic C Compiler ðŸ§™The Magic C Compiler, not really magic.## AboutThe Magic C Compiler (mcc) is a handwritten C compiler (no bison, etc.)  It targets the following architectures:    - i386 (32-bit, x86)    - AMD64 (64-bit, x64)    - ARM32 (32-bit for ARM)    - ARM64 (64-bit for ARM)    - *maybe* i8086 (16-bit)  ## PlatformIt is written to support all platforms (Linux, Windows, BSD, Darwin (MacOS), Popcorn, ...)  None of them is currently supported. ðŸ˜¥## Why another compilerWriting compilers is fun.## Building?Building the compiler is pretty easy, you need a linker, a C compiler.  Then type in (depending on the architecture):      `86` for i386, will make mcc86      `64` for AMD64, will make mcc64      `A86` for ARM32, will make mcca86      `A64` for ARM64, will make mcca64  For platforms, only Linux is supported.### Bootstrapping?Replace in the Makefile:        `CC=cc` by `CC=./mcc86` (for the 32-bit architecture.)
